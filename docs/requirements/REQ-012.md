# REQ-012: Advanced Client Controls

**ID:** REQ-012
**Domain:** Control
**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P1 (Important)

## Description

The application MUST provide advanced client and group management capabilities: context menus, inline rename, per-client latency adjustment, and network monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Right-click context menus on groups and clients
- [x] Inline rename for clients via `Client.SetName` API
- [x] Inline rename for groups via `Group.SetName` API
- [x] Per-client latency adjustment (-1000 to +1000 ms) via interactive QSpinBox
- [x] Latency control sends `Client.SetLatency` API call on edit finish
- [x] Latency spinbox shown only for connected clients; read-only text for disconnected
- [x] Network RTT ping measurement updated every 15 seconds
- [x] Color-coded latency: green (<50ms), yellow (50-100ms), red (>100ms)
- [x] Cross-platform ping support (macOS/Linux/Windows flag differences)

## Implementation

- **Context Menus:** `src/snapctrl/ui/widgets/group_card.py`, `client_card.py`
- **Latency UI:** `src/snapctrl/ui/panels/properties.py` — QSpinBox with `editingFinished` signal
- **Latency API:** `src/snapctrl/api/client.py` — `set_client_latency()`
- **Ping:** `src/snapctrl/core/ping.py` — Background RTT measurement
- **PRs:** [#8](https://github.com/lollonet/snapctrl/pull/8) (context menus), [#14](https://github.com/lollonet/snapctrl/pull/14) (latency)
