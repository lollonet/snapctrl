# REQ-010: System Tray Integration

**ID:** REQ-010
**Domain:** UI/UX
**Status:** Partial
**Priority:** P1 (Important)

## Description

The application MUST provide a system tray icon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Minimize to tray instead of closing (close-to-tray behavior)
- [ ] Tray icon shows connection status (currently static icon)
- [x] Right-click menu: Show/Hide, Quit
- [x] Quick volume controls for each group (embedded QWidgetAction slider)
- [ ] Mute All / Unmute All

## Remaining Work

- Dynamic tray icon reflecting connection state (connected/disconnected)
- Mute All / Unmute All menu entries

## Implementation Notes

- SystemTrayManager in `src/snapcast_mvp/ui/system_tray.py`
- Show/Hide window toggle (double-click or menu)
- Group status entries with average volume percentages
- Now Playing metadata from sources
- Debounced menu rebuild on state changes (500ms)
- [PR #13](https://github.com/lollonet/snapctrl/pull/13)
